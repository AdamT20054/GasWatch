## Reporting a Vulnerability

Any vulnerabilites can be reported through my Discord (Adam20054#0001), you can message any of the `Bot Developers` in the support server (https://discord.gg/YbtckEktmn) also.
If a vulnerability poses no threat, you can create an issue.

If you come across a vulnerability that may be exploitable by other people, and could pose harm to the bot, its systems or the servers it governs please privately report them.
